This project was built to summarize and practice fundamental Android concepts, including:

- 🎨 **Jetpack Compose**: declarative UI framework for Android
- 🧩 **Manual Dependency Injection**: no Hilt, DI is done manually
- ⏱️ **Kotlin Coroutines**: for asynchronous and background tasks
- 🗃️ **Room (SQLite)**: for local database storage
- 📦 **Repository Pattern**: abstracts data sources
